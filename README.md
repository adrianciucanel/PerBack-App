# PerBack-App
HCI 2015 project (FII)

The backpackers travel a lot through foreign countries, often get lost or don't know how to get around in a 
foreign place. PerBack is an application (to be used on mobile and wearable devices such as smartphones, tablets, watches, etc.) that will help these backpackers get around in a foreign country. For example, the application will provide support for actions like find a tourist information point, where to eat/sleep, contact local hospitals, contact mountain rescue â€“ if lost in a mountain, etc. The application will also keep track of the user health status and trip progress.
